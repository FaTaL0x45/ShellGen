version 1.3.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- There was a mistake I made when no arguments given, it should have displayed help menu but it didn't (quit working somwhere in v1.1 I belive)

  Second fase commit
  - I screwed up some code
  - Was able to fix the issue and now it's all good. Just run `git pull` in the directory that this tool is located in

~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 1.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add the option to pass the interface instead of using IP. Yes, you can still use the IP address but I find it easier to use the interface
  and let the script grab the IP address.
- Add a version comparison to let the end user know that there is a new update. Implemented in this version so previously, if you have not updated to this version
  you will not be informed that there is a new update.

~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Make the script run the help menu if no input is detected and/or if there is a user input error

~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Cleared up some code
- Added ALL SHELLS into src/allshells.py for more clarity when adding new ones
